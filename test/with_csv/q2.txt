The Global CO₂ Emissions dataset contains annual carbon dioxide emissions for countries worldwide.
It includes information such as country name, year, total emissions, and per capita emissions.

- Covers over 200 countries
- Data from 1750 to the most recent year
- Available in open-source formats (CSV, XLSX)

Structure of the Excel file (columns of interest):

- country (string): Country name
- year (integer): Year of observation
- co2 (float): Annual CO₂ emissions (million tonnes)
- co2_per_capita (float): CO₂ emissions per person (tonnes)

Sample row:
country,year,co2,co2_per_capita
India,2020,2442.38,1.78
