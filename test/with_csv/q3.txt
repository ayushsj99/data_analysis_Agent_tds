The Global Earthquake dataset from USGS records all seismic activity for the past 30 days (with daily updates).
It includes details such as time, location (lat/lon), depth, magnitude, and descriptive place info.

- Covers global earthquake events over the most recent 30-day period
- Freely downloadable CSV from USGS earthquake feed

Important CSV columns:

- time (datetime): When the earthquake occurred (UTC)
- latitude (float): Epicenter latitude
- longitude (float): Epicenter longitude
- depth (float): Depth in kilometers
- mag (float): Magnitude
- place (string): Description of location
- magType (string): Magnitude measurement scale (e.g., mb, Mw)

Sample row:

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON object containing the answer:

{
  "What is the maximum earthquake magnitude in the dataset?": "...",
  "What's the average depth of earthquakes with magnitude â‰¥ 5?": "...",
  "Plot magnitude vs. depth for all events as a scatterplot with a regression line. Encode as a base64 data URI under 100,000 characters": "data:image/webp;base64,..."
}
